# reflections

Overview
To allow you to focus on project work, we combined the unit 15 and unit 16 homework into a mini-project, which should have been submitted as part of the week 15 assignment.
For this week, take a moment to reflect on your experience in the program so far.
Submit a short write up (one to two paragraphs) that speak to things like:

What do you like, love and dislike about the experience?
What are some things that you plan to do with your new superpowers?
Any other remarks that you would like to share


Submission

Place your write up in a Microsoft Word document
Load it to a reflections repository on GitHub
Submit the link to your write up in Boot Camp Spot in the Week 16 (D3) homework slot by 2/7/2021
