    <h1>My Reflection</h1>
    <h3>As I reflect on this experience with of being apart of the Data Bootcamp,
        there are things I wish I can do over. I felt like my focus started to fade at times,
        I could get ahold of my distraction <br> and I had no time management. I will try to do everything at once instead of
        taking things at a slower pace and breaking in down into chunks. There is so much I feel I need to review 
        and study <br> and I feel the fast pace learning only works if you are already familar with
        the information. I do feel I have learn alot, but I stil feel I have a lot more the learn and master. <br>
        <br>
        Now that I have learned all these great tools, I am going to apply them to my current job and creat projects for myself to enhance my learning. <br>
        <br> This have been the most amazing, beautiful, most challenging, crazy, fustrating experience of my life. <br>
        But what doesnt kill you makes you stronger.</h3>
